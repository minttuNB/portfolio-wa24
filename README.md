## Notes

The authentication system is very barebones, and only implemented for getting projects. Set a cookie named `user.id` with the value `dba76a8c-6bc1-4d92-b00f-7361faf71681` to see unpublished projects appear for the authorized user. Creating projects has been set to saving them as published by default in order to reduce confusion.
